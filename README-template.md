## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow



### What I learned

  My first thought about this challenge was that it is easy, and because of that I did not plan well enough. I did not realize how important it is to plan your work well and that experience in building websites is one of the most important apsects of FrontEnd because it allows the developer to increase effectivness of his work. Experience plays a key role in building the website, as well as elements that come togheter into a website, such as, CSS classes that control display of elements fro desktop and mobile website. What is also important is that experience plays a key role in looking for answers when encoutering a problem. If You have experienced problem similar or related to the one at hand, you probably know where to look for answers or at least have and idea where to start.
  


### Continued development

My focus for a few next months is still performing the Frontend Mentor challenges, because that is the base of my experience building process.
At the same time I am learning from JavaScript course to prepare properly for a framework.

Things to learn for now are:

- JS course needs to be finished - 35 of 42 chapters done
- 5 FrontEnd Mentor Junior challenges
- Use git constantly
