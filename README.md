What I learned

  My first thought about this challenge was that it is easy, and of course I did not plan well enough. I did not realize how important it is to plan your work well and that experience in building websites is one of the most important apsects of FrontEnd because it allows the developer to increase effectivness of his work. Experience plays a key role in building CSS classes that can control elements over whole website, as well as experience guides the developer through new problems he may encounter, and it is the experience that shows the developer where to look for answers.
  
    

Continued development

My focus for a few next months is still performing the Frontend Mentor challenges, because that is the base of my experience building process.
At the same time I am learning from JavaScript course to prepare properly for a framework.

Things to learn for now are:

- JS course needs to be finished - 35 of 42 chapters done
- 5 FrontEnd Mentor Junior challenges
- Use git constantly
